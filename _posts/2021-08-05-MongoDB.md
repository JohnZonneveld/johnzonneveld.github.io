**Install mongodb locally**

For my mern project to avoid problems with remote connections I decided to use a local mongodb installation.  
The installation itself is pretty simple, all that is needed when brew is installed is:  
'brew install mongodb-community@5.0'  
to install the latest version.

**Run mongodb as a service**

After installation you have two choices to run the mongodb. You can either run it manually from the command line or run it as a service.  
To run mongodb on a Mac as a service you have to run the command:"brew services start mongodb-community@5.0" The '5.0' can differ depending on your installation.
After this mongodb will run in the background.
The normal services commands are valid.
To stop the service issue the command:
brew services stop mongodb-community@5.0
To restart:
brew services restart mongodb-community@5.0
