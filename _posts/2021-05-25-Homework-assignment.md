title: Homeworks Assignment!

Well I guess I made it with hurdles. Sometimes live is happening and stands in the way of progress. Will not say too much about it, but it sure could have been a lot easier to hit the end of the Software Engineering Bootcamp. Only needed some cooperation of a person very close to me. Let's leave it with that.

To my surprise I passed my project 5 review on first try. I would have liked to be a little better prepared, but a nightly worktrip from 11pm till 630am sure didn't help. Guess after that I needed my beauty sleep.

For the livecoding the reviewer wanted me to change my 'ToursList' page to have a like button and a field to change the number of likes that were given per click. There was no need to persist it to the back-end. So, after a page refresh or leaving the page and coming back to the ToursList page, it was allowed to start over from 'no likes'.
